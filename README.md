# PyTorch-ResNet-CIFAR10

This is a PyTorch implementation of Residual Networks as described in the paper [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) by Microsoft Research Asia. It follows the description of ResNet configuration on page 7 of the paper for the CIFAR-10 image classification task, and allows any value of _n_(determining the number of layers) to be entered from the command line.
